# Food

Harvesters Mobile Pantry has been a wonderful resource for previous VISTAs. Their drive-up food pantry operates daily across KCMO and KCK. 
A list of times and locations is published every year and is available online. The yummiest local stop, Thelma's Kitchen, is only $2 for VISTAs!

There are plenty of fun and *free* things to do in Kansas City! Do you like beer? Boulevard Brewery has free tours every Wednesday, and 
afterwards your first two pints are on them. Not a drinker? The Roasterie has a similar tour where you can enjoy some local air-roasted
coffee. The local art museum, The Nelson-Atkins, is free to everyone every day. Ask a local around the library for even more ideas!
