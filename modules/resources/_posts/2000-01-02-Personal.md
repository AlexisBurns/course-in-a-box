# Self Care 

Never forget that VISTA service is a true sacrifice for the greater good. You are appreciated and important, so remember that maintaining a work-life balance during this year of service is critical. You have vacation time and sick days- **use them!** Your mental health is just as important as your physical health, so mental health days are ***encouraged.***  

You are valuable to this project! If you are struggling and need support at any time during your year, your VISTA Coordinator is available to talk.
