# Welcome to the Kansas City Public Library VISTA Project!

Our group is quickly growing, and we are glad to have you on board! Feel free to return to this site if you need a 
refresher over the next year. Throughout these tabs we will define what is expected of VISTAs, explain how you will 
keep track of your service, and explore what it is like to serve in Kansas City. 

Thank you for choosing to serve with us, we are grateful to have you!
