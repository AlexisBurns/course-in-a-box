# What is it? 

Cultural humility is a process of self-reflection and discovery in order to build honest and trustworthy relationships. This involves consistent self-awareness and an interpersonal approach to cultural identites. We are all from different backgrounds, and are experts in our own stories. To begin learning other people's stories requires sensitivity, reflection, and active listening. 

# Why is it important?

VISTAs have a responsibility to be supportive members of the communities they join- we cannot do truly valuable work without being culturally competent.
