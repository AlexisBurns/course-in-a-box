title: Capacity Building Versus Direct Service
---

# Capacity Building 

CNCS defines capacity building as *"a set of activities that expand the scale, reach, efficiency,
or effectiveness of programs and organizations."* This can mean improving resources at your site, introducing those resources to a new portion of the community, or creating new resources entirely! 

A great example of capacity building within the Library's VISTA project is the **Martin Luther King Jr. Day Hygiene Kit Drive.** Library VISTAs use the library branches and various community partners to collect donations of basic hygiene products like soap , shampoo, and period products. Afterwards they come together in a day of service to create kits of these materials to be passed out around the Metro. This utilizes existing resources, supports the community by making an abundance of necessities readily available, and can be easily recreated at different sites with a team of any size. 

# Direct Service 

This is the act of providing services to recipients or clients of a program. While you may find yourself delivering services to the patrons of your organizations from time to time, the core value of VISTA is sustainability. Simply ask yourself, if I were not here could this orgnaization maintain the work I am doing? During your year of service, look at the big picture! VISTAs are here to make an impact- strive to leave an organization better than you found it!
