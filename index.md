## Welcome Onboard! 

The Kansas City Public Library is happy to have VISTAs serving in the Metro area! As an intermediary, the Library partners with local organizations to host VISTAs. So whether you are working here at KCPL or at another site, we are all a team! Our group is quickly growing, and we are glad to have you on board. Throughout these tabs we will define what is expected of VISTAs, explain how you will keep track of your service, and explore what it is like to serve in Kansas City.

Thank you for choosing to serve with us, we are grateful to have you! You are welcome to visit this site if you ever need additional resources, or just to refresh your memory. Thank you for joining our team!

## Let's get started!
