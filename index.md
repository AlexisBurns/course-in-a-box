## Welcome to the Kansas City Public Library VISTA Project! 

As an intermediary, the Library partners with local organizations serving as AmeriCorps VISTA member host sites. AmeriCorps VISTA members provide a year of service, bringing their passion and perseverance where the need is greatest: to organizations that help eradicate poverty.

## We are always learning and growing!
