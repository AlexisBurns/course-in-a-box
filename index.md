## Welcome Onboard! 

The Kansas City Public Library is happy to have VISTAs serving in the Metro. As an intermediary, the Library partners with local organizations to host VISTAs. So whether you are working here at KCPL or at another site, we are all a team! You are welcome to visit this site if you ever need additional resources, or just to refresh your memory. Let's get started!

## Thank you for joining our team!
